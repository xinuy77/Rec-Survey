Limpy. Limpy is a fuzzy, yellow, baby duck.  He belongs to a fisherman.  The fisherman lives in a little house by the bay.  Every morning children go swimming in the bay.  About 10:00, Limpy waddles out to the road to wait for the children.  When he hears them coming he begins a loud, excited quacking. The children always bring bread or corn for Limpy.  He will nip at their fingers or peck at their bare toes until he is fed.  Limpy never follows the children down to the shore.  He likes to swim in his own little pond.  It is much safer.
